# Managing Pokémon List State with RxJS

This project demonstrates how to use RxJS to manage the state of a Pokémon list in a reactive way. The RxJS library provides powerful tools for handling asynchronous data streams, making it easier to manage dynamic updates to the Pokémon list.

## Features

- **Reactive State Management**: Manage Pokémon list updates in real time using RxJS observables and operators.
- **Asynchronous Data Handling**: Fetch Pokémon data asynchronously and manage responses using RxJS.
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean and maintainable code structure with RxJS streams to handle side effects.
